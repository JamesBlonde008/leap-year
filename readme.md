This program will help you determine if any given year is a leap year. Just enter any year
into the form field and click the button to find out if you get an extra day this year.

Here are the program specs:

If the entered year is divisible by 4 the program will tell you this is a leap year.
If the entered year is divisible by 100 the program will tell you this is not a lear year.
